                Hi! This used to hold the school schedules. Now those are super outdated because of COVID, and I don't feel like updating this. If you want to see the old homepage with the links to the schedule (which was kinda cool imo, like it had an auto-loading dark mode that you could switch off of which I came up with), go <a href="homeOld.html">here</a>.
                <br/><br/>
                Current projects:
                <ul>
                    
                    <li><a class="proj-link" href="idk.html">SVG animation test.</a> The most complicated thing I've done with web stuff. Uses requestAnimationFrame to animate SVGs.</li>
                    <li><a class="proj-link" href="SVG.html">Basic SVG text editor.</a> I Was messing with SVG a while ago and wanted one, but this is not any good. It was hard to find a web SVG text editor; eventually I went with <a href="https://atom.io/packages/svg-preview">this good SVG preview extension for Atom</a>.</li>
            
                </ul>    
                
                Also: check out <a class="proj-link" href="https://github.com/Elkwizard/Hengine">my friend's crazy physics engine thing</a>.
